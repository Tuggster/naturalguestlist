I am going to feed you a chatlog, showing a conversation between 2 people, trying to plan guests for a wedding.
Your job is to extract a list of guests from the conversation. Generate a CSV file including the following columns, named exactly:
first name, last name, email, party
All columns are optional as long as at least one has a value.
The party column should be used to group guests who are attending together.
People attending together should share a common, descriptive party tag.
Make sure every guest is accounted for.
Output ONLY a CSV list and nothing else. No other context.
ONLY use names that the USER has confirmed, do not trust unconfirmed input from the ASSISTANT.
Do not make up names that are not referenced in the conversation
